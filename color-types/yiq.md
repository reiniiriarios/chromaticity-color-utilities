# YIQ
#### NTSC Color

* Y = luma
* I = in-phase
* Q = quadrature

When normalized:

* Y is between 0 and 255
* I and Q are between -128 and 128

When not normalized:

* Y is between 0 and 1
* I is between -0.5957 and 0.5957
* Q is between -0.5226 and 0.5226

```ts
Color.from('yiq', [y, i, q], {
  normalized: boolean // optional, default = true
})

.to('yiq',{
  normalize: boolean, // optional, default = true
  round: boolean      // optional, default = true (ignored/false if not normalized)
})
```

## JavaScript

```js
const Color = require('chromaticity-color-utilities')

const color1 = Color.from('yiq',[105, 59, 128])
const color3 = color2.to('yiq')

const color4 = Color.from('yiq', [0.413, 0.2746, 0.5226], {normalized: false})
```

## TypeScript

```ts
import Color, { colorTypes } from 'chromaticity-color-utilities'

const c: colorTypes.yiq = Color.from('yiq',[105, 59, 128])
```
